> Building blockchain solutions for financial inclusion and agent-based economic models

## About Me

👨‍💻 Entrepreneur and Fellow at the Mercator Foundation, where I focus on developing innovative financial technologies for social impact. My work centers on blockchain-based finance solutions for emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on regions with limited banking infrastructure.

🔍 My technical and economic background spans both Asia and Europe, giving me a global perspective on fintech challenges and opportunities in diverse markets.

## Current Projects

🚀 **Blockchain Microloans for Financial Inclusion**: Leading an initiative to provide ultra-small loans ("nano loans") to underserved individuals using blockchain technology and digital identity verification. We leverage smart contracts and on-chain credit scoring to minimize defaults and increase lending efficiency in communities traditionally excluded from financial services.

📊 **NanoLoan Simulation**: Creator of an agent-based modeling system that simulates microfinance operations to optimize lending parameters and understand economic impact. This open-source tool helps visualize borrower behavior, loan progression, and financial outcomes in various scenarios.

## Areas of Expertise

- 📈 Agent-based economic modeling and simulation
- 💰 Microfinance systems and progressive lending
- 🛡️ Risk modeling for underbanked populations
